## What is Easy Defines?  
Easy Defines is a free, and open source, solution to global defines in Unity. It is a simple editor extension that adds a new window to Unity where defines can be added and toggled for different types of scripts. Currently it supports C#, Unityscript, and Editor scripts. All global defines are stored in a text file, which makes source control much easier. 

This is still very much a work in progress, and I would love feedback on ease of use and workflow. This project will always remain free and open source, so please feel free to use as you see fit. Also, if you would like to contribute in any way just let me know!
